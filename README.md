# BioHackrXiv Fediwall

This is a fork for the MetSoc2025. Below is the original README:

Fediwall is a *media wall* application made for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). Follow hashtags or accounts and show the most recent posts in a self-updating,
screen filling and visually pleasing masonry grid layout. Put it on a large screen and showcase community feedback or social media reactions while hosting your next
big event, or use it to look at cat pictures all day. Your choice.

**Try it!** Check out the BioHackrXiv [Fediwall](https://fediwall.biohackrxiv.org/) or host your own (see below).
